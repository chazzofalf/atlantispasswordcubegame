!!!!!!!! ! indicates this is a hero's name. This negates death one time from a dreadlord. Protection from death from all cases except for which are marked as !!! (Supervillian) Nobody is saving from The Favorite One (She has a six percent chance of purposefully showing up. Now you could accidentally provoke any of the dreadlords by forming their name through your moves)! Except Jesus (Marked !!!!) Who has a only a 7% chance showing up in a puzzle. He can only be called upon once all subsequent formations are ignored. --- denotes end of current entity!  I added a backstory/mythology that should show up in help/character mythology portition of the app.

TAMMUZ*
*TAMMUZ!!!!!! The Favorite One's cohort and life-long commited and loving companion. The Supreme Grand High Dreadlord. Not really a distinct dreadlord from The Favorite One. Functions more like a extra set of hands in the Favorite One's office. he might kill you just as readily as The Favorite One or he might have mercy on you since you are his doppelganger. (Time travel is weird. Perhaps I will be able to share and expand on this in a complete version of the backstory written in a full tome outside of this app.) But he will only commit this betrayal of the favorite one of keeping  you only safe once!) Also helps guard the Key-Prime.

LILLITH Dark Mistress of THIS universe. She is sort of a hermetic, recusive individual. Stuck in her own head and therefore not very influencal. Hid herself deep within an cold, and dark icy planet so she could deeply meditate and trap herself inside her vivid imaginary world. She was there in that very trance when our hero found her and quickly dispatched of her. This started the major conflict between the New Federation and Magaeians that took decades to completely resolve.

*HEYZEUS*!!!!  You can say he is the Favorite One's boss although she would vehemently disagree. One could say he is everyone's boss but you might disagree. It is your choice what you believe. Used a special mulligan to counteract the Favorite One showing up on the board. In fact he only works to block the Favorite One none of the other Dreadlords.
