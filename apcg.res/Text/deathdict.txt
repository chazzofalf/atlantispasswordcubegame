(Supervillian) Nobody is saving from The Favorite One (She has a six percent chance of purposefully showing up. Now you could accidentally provoke any of the dreadlords by forming their name through your moves)! Except Jesus (Marked !!!!) Who has a only a 7% chance showing up in a puzzle. He can only be called upon once all subsequent formations are ignored. --- denotes end of current entity!  I added a backstory/mythology that should show up in help/character mythology portition of the app.

LILLITH Dark Mistress of THIS universe. She is sort of a hermetic, recusive individual. Stuck in her own head and therefore not very influencal. Hid herself deep within an cold, and dark ice planet until so she could meditate and trap herself in her imaginary world. She was there in that very trance when our hero found her and quickly dispatched of her. This started the major conflict between the New Federation and Magaeians that took decades to completely resolve.

*HEYZEUS*!!!!  You can say he is the Favorite One's boss although she would vehemently disagree. One could say he is everyone's boss but you might disagree. It is your choice what you believe. Used a special mulligan to counteract the Favorite One showing up on the board. In fact he only works to block the Favorite One none of the other Dreadlords.
